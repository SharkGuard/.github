Welcome! We are a dynamic group of Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, MLOps professionals, and AI enthusiasts. Our mission is to advance the field of responsible artificial intelligence by creating and sharing publicly available research and open-source tools.

We focus on building frameworks for safe, reliable, and fair AI systems. We believe in community-driven innovation to solve the key challenges in AI safety and moderation.

# Our Core Areas of Focus:

- ***🎯 AI Safety & Alignment:*** Ensuring AI systems operate as intended by aligning their objectives with human values to prevent harmful outcomes.

- ***🚦 Guardrails & Moderation:*** Designing robust technical safeguards, filters, and moderation systems to keep AI interactions within ethical boundaries.

- ***🛡️ AI Security Operations (AISecOps):*** Securing AI systems from adversarial attacks, including jailbreaking, prompt injection, and data poisoning.

- ***🤖 Agentic AI Security & Containment:*** Addressing the unique security challenges of autonomous agents through sandboxing, safe tool usage, and robust fail-safe mechanisms.

- ***📈 Model Performance & Analytics:*** Moving beyond simple accuracy to develop sophisticated benchmarks that measure model reliability, robustness, and efficiency.

- ***🔍 Explainability & Interpretability (XAI):*** Working on techniques to make "black box" models transparent and understandable, revealing their internal logic.

- ***📊 Data Integrity & Bias:*** Actively identifying and mitigating biases in datasets to ensure fairness and prevent the perpetuation of societal inequalities.

- ***⚖️ Uncertainty Quantification:*** Researching methods to measure a model's confidence, distinguishing what it knows from what it doesn't.
